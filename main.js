ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!

Write a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a sorted (ascending) array of the number's factors (a factor is a number that divides another number or expression evenly with no remainders).

If the argument is 0, return the following string: '0 is not divisible'.
If a negative number is passed as an argument, convert it to a positive number.
TIP: Do not hesitate to google Array.sort if you need help with sorting numbers in ascending order.


For example:
factors(10) returns [1, 2, 5, 10]

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export default function factors(number) {
